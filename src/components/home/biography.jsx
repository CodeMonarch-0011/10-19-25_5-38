        James H. Harrington III — professionally known as Jay Harrington — was
        born on November 15, 1971, in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Raised in a
        suburban New England environment, Harrington discovered performance
        early: high school theater productions and school sports gave him stage
        instincts and a sense of teamwork that would serve him throughout his
        career. <br />
        After graduating high school, Harrington pursued formal study in theatre
        and performance, sharpening his craft in regional theatre and then
        moving to roles in off-Broadway and small film projects. His early
        professional years were a classical actor’s apprenticeship: guest TV
        spots, stage productions, and small films where he learned to inhabit a
        wide range of characters. That steady foundation paved the way to
        national recognition in the mid-2000s and a string of memorable
        television roles.

        Harringtonâ€™s evolution toward directing and producing suggests a second
        act that keeps him central to television storytelling, not only as an
        actor but as a creative force behind series development. Whether
        returning to stage work, leading new pilots, or directing across drama

        valued collaborator for future projects.
